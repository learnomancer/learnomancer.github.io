In this video tutorial, we'll be exploring what happens when you want to display checkmarks next to each answer in order to provide feedback to your users in Articulate Storyline 360.

We will use a graded question slide with shuffle answers enabled. Even though our answers are set to a random order every time the question loads, we still want the checkmarks to appear next to their assigned answer.

We will use a Storyline bug and copy our checkmarks into the normal state of each answer so that they can move when the answer boxes move.

We will also use the GSAP Javascript library to affect the opacity / transparency of our checkmarks, so that we can hide and unhide them on the correct and incorrect feedback layers.

Hope you enjoy these tips and tricks. ðŸ™‚
